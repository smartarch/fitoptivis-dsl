This project is CLI application for extracting data about fully defined system element from the DSL text.

Since the DSL text is not contained within files of the file system, the entire DSL code will be received from stdin. 
Import statements are currently ignored, but due to them existing the API is designed to have both-way communication happening (e.g. the app will demand additional file to be sent over stdin).
The communication is done over stdin/stdout using simple json objects.


DSL Code file object:
{
	Name: "Name of object file",
	Content: "Content of the file"
}

Result:
{

}


Usage:

ModelExtractor --system $(system_name) < $(dsl_code_file_object)
